The fds is a small, cost effective module to provide a stable 12v, 3a over wagos.

- The fds is designed to power small components, like the roborio and radio, without needing a battery, nor any form of PDP/PDH.
- THe fsd cannot produce enough current to start a motor, even without a load.
- A smaller, less powerful wire-to-board connector has been supplied, along with the 120 Ohm termination resistor.
- Ths sdf can entirley replace a PDP/PDH for low current applications

The PD chip used here is the [CH221K](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/C5125736.html).
All other parts can be found [here](https://www.digikey.com/en/mylists/list/HRV7I1BS3E).

If you want to order directly for the unit without buying each part, you can order the [full module](https://example.com) or the [kit](https://example.org).

Any decent USB-C charger will work, as long as it can supply enough power.
